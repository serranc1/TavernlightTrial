This repository contains my attempts at the technical tests requested by Tavernlight.

Notes for reviewers:
- Tutorials for setting up the source code and OTClient were more complicated than expected due to errors caused by invalid header file paths and differences in versions of downloadables.
- Using OTLand IP Changer and a native Tibia client proved to be significantly easier to set up than setting up OTClient.
- Official documentation for functions and file locations and purposes was scarce, making it difficult to figure out how to use or modify existing functions and files or make new ones.
