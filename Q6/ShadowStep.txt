Lock player movement and turning input
Create a red outline around character by creating a duplicate red sprite with slightly larger size and layering it behind the character sprite.
While spell duration isn't finished and player is alive
  Make afterimages of character by using a for loop with a range i = 1 to 4 incrementing by 1, create a duplicate character sprite with opacity -20% * i and offset in the opposite direction of player cast direction by i * tileSize and duration set to spell duration
  Move character in cast direction at an increased speed if path is not blocked, otherwise stay still
If spell duration ends or player dies, remove outline and afterimages and restore movement controls
